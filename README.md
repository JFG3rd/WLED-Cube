# LED Cube with AudioReactive GLEDOPTO WLED Controllers

<span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Overview</span>

I designed a **cube on a stand** with six **16x16 RGB LED matrices**, controlled by **two GLEDOPTO WLED controllers** with built-in microphones. These controllers enable the **AudioReactive** function, allowing dynamic light patterns that respond to real-time audio input. The cube is perfect for creating immersive, music-driven light shows.

## **Key Features**

- **Six 16x16 RGB LED Matrices:**  
  The cube features six [16x16 RGB LED matrices](https://www.amazon.de/AZDelivery-Einzeladressierbare-Vollfarbfunktionen-Kompatibel-Raspberry/dp/B09X1RYJV8/ref=sr_1_1_sspa) (one on each side), offering a total of **1,536 individually addressable LEDs**.

- **Two GLEDOPTO WLED Controllers with Microphones:**  
  The cube is powered by [GLEDOPTO WLED controllers](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0CRB7JMQM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1), each controlling three LED matrices.  
  Each controller is designed to handle no more than **800 LEDs** to ensure smooth and responsive transitions of lighting effects. By splitting the load between two controllers, the cube maintains high performance, even during complex animations.

- **AudioReactive Mode:**  
  With the AudioReactive feature, the cube’s animations pulse and change in sync with ambient sounds or music, creating stunning visual patterns.

## **Future Improvements**

- **Voice Control Integration:**  
  Implementing voice commands to switch modes or patterns.

- **Advanced Animations:**  
  Adding more sophisticated, sound-reactive animation patterns.
